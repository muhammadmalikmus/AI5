<!-- # Large Language Models Group Activity -->

## Project Statement

In this mini project, you will have the opportunity to explore Language Models using an API of your choice, such as ChatGPT or any other AI API. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in utilizing Language Models and understanding their capabilities. You will select a use case or create a simple business case and implement it by leveraging the chosen API.

## Project Setup

In this mini project, you will work in groups of 2 or 3 to use a Language Model API for a specific task.

The duration for the activity is 3.5 hours. You should aim to spend your time like so:

- Choosing a topic: **10 minutes**
- Creating the project: **1 hour and 50 minutes**
- Implementing best practices to your code: **30 minutes**
- Preparing a presentation of the project: **30 minutes**
- Group discussion: **30 minutes**

# Instructions

## Step 1: Choose a Language Model API

You can use [GPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) or select an API provider, such as [Hugging Face API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), based on availability or personal preference. 

## Step 2: API Setup and Credentials

If you choose to use a different AI API than GPT, sign up for the selected API and obtain the necessary credentials or access tokens. Follow the provider's documentation to understand the authentication process and ensure you have the required permissions to make API requests.

## Step 3: Implementing the Use Case

Select and define a specific use case or business scenario where you can leverage the Language Model API. It could involve generating text, answering questions, providing recommendations, or any other language-related task. For more ideas take a look [here](https://platform.openai.com/examples).

***Note:** most of the code examples are done with the older API (Completions API). Remember to take them as inspiration, and do it with the new API Chat Completions.*

You should then write code to interact with the API. Experiment with different parameters, such as prompt input, temperature, and any other relevant parameters that impact the output generated by the Language Model.

Next, make API requests and analyze the responses to observe how the chosen parameters influence the results. Note any interesting findings or challenges encountered during the implementation.

Finally, make sure you prepare a Jupyter Notebook and/or Python files following best coding practices.

## Step 4: Presentation Preparation

Prepare a presentation to showcase your mini project. It should include the following elements:

- **Introduction:** Briefly describe the chosen use case or business scenario.
- **API Integration:** If you chose a different API, explain the process of integrating the API into your project, including how to send requests, handle responses, and manage authentication.
- **Code Explanation:** Share and explain the code you wrote for interacting with the API. Highlight important sections and any customizations you made. Discuss how changing parameters affected the generated text or responses.
- **Results and Findings:** Present the outcomes of your experiments.
- **Lessons Learned:** Reflect on the challenges faced, insights gained, and lessons learned during the mini project. Share any interesting observations or improvements you made based on your findings.

## Step 5: Group Feedback and Reflection

With your entire class you will now participate in a reflective discussion led by a member of the teaching team. You will discuss the the opportunities and challenges of integrating Language Model APIs in application development, as well as the ethical considerations involved.
