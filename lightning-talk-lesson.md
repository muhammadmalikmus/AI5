## Introduction

Lightning Talks are a popular format of presentation that aims to deliver a concise and focused message in a short span of time. They are designed to be engaging, informative, and most importantly, brief. As part of the bootcamp, you and your peers will have the chance to carry out a lightning talk on a topic if your choosing. This will allow you to carry out some additional research on an area that interests you and practice presentation skills.

## What is a Lightning Talk?

A Lightning Talk is a very short presentation that lasts only a few minutes but is aimed at quickly conveying key information or insights on a topic. It's like a snapshot of a subject, designed to grab your attention, provoke thought, all within the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee.

## Guidelines

The lightning talks will take place according to a schedule decided with your lead teacher typically at the beginning of the day. The length of a Lightning Talk is typically about 5 minutes. This may seem short, but you'd be surprised how much you can convey in such a small amount of time when you focus on the essentials. Keep in mind that since it is so brief, every second counts. It's crucial to use your time wisely and stick to your main points to ensure your message is delivered clearly and effectively. This quick format will push you to refine your ideas and thoughts into the most crucial and impactful points from the research you have carried out.

## Choosing a Topic

The topic for your Lightning Talk can be chosen from a predefined list, revolving around  subjects related to the curriculum, or broader topics of interest in the field. You are also encouraged to propose your own topics if there's something you would like to speak about. If you have a unique idea, concept, or area of interest that you'd like to explore and share with your peers, you are welcome to propose this as your Lightning Talk topic. The only caveat is that it should be well-researched, relevant, and feasible to present within the given time frame.

You will find a list of topics in the document below. 

1. Your teacher will make a copy of the document for your cohort
2. You may either choose a topic or get one assigned to you. You are also allowed to create a topic in the “Proposed Topics” section at the end of the document
3. You or your teacher will fill in the “Name of student” and “Date of talk” fields for each topic to organise the schedule of the Lightning Talks

## Summary

Lightning Talks are a unique and engaging way to learn and share knowledge. It's a fun challenge that will not only improve your presentation skills but also your ability to distil complex ideas into clear, succinct points. So, get ready to enlighten your peers with your Lightning Talk!
